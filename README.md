# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

"In the Hangman Python project, l embarked on the creation of a word-guessing game. The project's development involved several key steps: First, l implemented the core game logic, selecting words and initializing game state variables. User interaction was then introduced, allowing players to guess individual letters. The word to be guessed was displayed with underscores, with each correct guess updating the display. Win-and-lose conditions were set, where players either successfully guessed the word or faced defeat with too many incorrect guesses. "
